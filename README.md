# Story Generator

A Python script that generates random story content for an **alternate universe** by interpreting a JSON data matrix. 
The matrix consists of **three files** located in the `data` folder 
( and it's easy enough to change all the JSON content to make YOUR OWN universe...):
- `story.json`
- `settings.json`
- `events.json`
- `characters.json`

## **File Structure**
For smooth execution, ensure the following file structure:

parent-folder/
â”‚â”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ story.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ characters.json
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ story_generator.py
â”‚â”€â”€ .gitignore

## **How to Use**
1. **Download** the repository or manually set up the file structure.
2. Navigate to the **parent folder** where `story_generator.py` lives.
3. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   python story_generator.py

- The script will generate three short "news" items based on the JSON data matrix.
The End
Enjoy exploring the randomly generated alternate universe! ðŸš€
