  "HEADLINE: Chaos in {setting_name}! Reports flooding the data-net indicate that {character_name}, the {character_type} known for being {character_trait}, has {event_action_past}, sparked by {event_object_catalyst}. The local constabulary is struggling to deal with the fallout, which includes {event_consequence}. Witnesses described the scene near {setting_feature} as 'utterly discombobulated.' {character_name} was last heard saying, \"{character_quote}\"",
  "RUMOR MILL: Whispers on the digital wind suggest that {character_name} is laying low in {setting_description} after their recent escapade. Apparently, their attempt to {character_goal} went sideways, leading to {event_consequence}. The atmosphere in {setting_name} is now {setting_atmosphere}.",
  "FROM THE DESK OF THE EDITOR: Tensions are higher than a vulture circling a downed drone in {setting_name}. The recent {event_type} involving {character_name} has everyone on edge. This {character_type}, true to their reputation for being {character_trait}, {event_action_past} over {event_object_catalyst}. The long-term effects are predicted to be {event_consequence}. One thing's for sure, it's never dull on the cyber-prairie!",
  "DISPATCH FROM {setting_name}: A strange event unfolded today. {character_name}, the {character_type} with a goal to {character_goal}, reportedly {event_action_past}. This was apparently triggered by {event_object_catalyst}. The situation has resulted in {event_consequence}. The {setting_feature} is now a focal point of the investigation. '{character_quote}' was the only comment {character_name} offered.",
  "WANTED: {character_name}! This {character_type} is sought for questioning regarding a recent {event_type} in {setting_description}. Known for being {character_trait} and often heard muttering \"{character_quote}\", they were last seen near {setting_feature}. Their actions concerning {event_object_catalyst} have led to {event_consequence}. Approach with caution; this individual is considered {character_trait} and unpredictable."
